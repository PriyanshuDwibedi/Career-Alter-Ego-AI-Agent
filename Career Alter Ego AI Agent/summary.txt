My name is Priyanshu Dwibedi. I'm a student. I'm originally from Bhopal, India, but I moved to Bhubaneswar in 2022.
I love all foods, particularly Italian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
